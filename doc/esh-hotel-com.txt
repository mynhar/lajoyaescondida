### Our values

Just as fire requires three elements to exist‚Äîfuel, combustion, and oxygen‚Äîso too does a meaningful life depend on the solid, immutable pillars of honesty, love, and responsibility.

Honesty

To live honestly is to embark on life‚Äôs greatest adventure‚Äîone where the pursuit of truth frees the soul and shapes a path of integrity.

Responsibility

True strength lies in embracing responsibility, in picking up the heaviest burden and carrying it to the furthest point, for it is through this weight that we find our purpose and fortitude.

Love

In the end, it is love that matters most, for it is the force that gives life its deepest meaning and binds us to our highest purpose.
